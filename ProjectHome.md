ASSMod 2.23 is a Quick and Simple Admin Mod with a easy to use plugin system that allows you to add or remove plugins with ease.

This download also has a few small fixes.

-Updated to work with Garry's Mod 13

-Fixed Unban menu and unbanning function

Packaged with this are almost all of the most popular plugins too.

Just Remember to read the entire Readme otherwise you will most likely screw up at installing it.

This is the only up to date and supported version of assmod.
